# PrintBinaryString

  A string that contains only 0s and 1s is called a binary string. Let n be a positive integer.
Write a recursive method for listing all binary strings of length n that does not contain two consecutive
1s. For example if n = 5 the method should print the binary strings 00000, 00001, 00010, 00100, 00101,
01000, 01001, 01010, 10000, 10001, 10010, 10100, and 10101 in some order. Write a report for explaining
in detail how your algorithm works for n = 5.


# PrintSum

  Let n be a positive integer. Write a recursive method for listing all ways of writing n as the
sum of a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers. For example if n = 5 the method should print the
equations 5 = 5, 5 = 4+ 1, 5 = 3+ 2, 5 = 3+ 1+ 1, 5 = 2+ 2+ 1, 5 = 2+1+ 1+ 1, and 5 = 1+ 1+ 1+1+ 1
in some order. Write a report for explaining in detail how your algorithm works for n = 5.
